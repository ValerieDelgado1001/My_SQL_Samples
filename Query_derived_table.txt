-- I created a derived table returning Age and MaxBloodPressure from a table called Kidney and grouped by Age. 
Joined the derived tble to the main query on the BloodPressure equal to the MaxBloodPressure and Age.

SELECT *
FROM Kidney a
JOIN (SELECT Age, MAX(BloodPressure) AS MaxBloodPressure
            FROM Kidney GROUP BY Age) b
ON a.bloodPressure = b.MaxBloodPressure
AND a.Age = b.Age
