-- In this example I summarize the distribution of the number of questions with the tag 'dropbox' on the Stackoverflow data per day by 
binning the data using generate_series() function. 

WITH bins AS (
	SELECT generate_series(2200, 3050, 50) AS lower
	       generate_series(2250, 3100, 50) AS upper),

dropbox AS (
	SELECT question_count
	FROM Stackoverflow
	WHERE tag = 'dropbox')

SELECT lower, upper, COUNT(question_count)
FROM bins
    LEFT JOIN dropbox
    ON question_count >= lower
    AND question_count < upper
GROUP BY lower, upper
ORDER BY lower;


-- I started by collecting the 'dropbox' data in the question_count column in the Stackoverflow data frame. Then I aliased the query 
as a CTE called dropbox to use in the final query. Then I built a query generating a series of bins with upper and lower values and
aliased that CTE as bins. Lastly, I created the final query that joined the bins and drop box tables to show the summary of the 
distribution of the question_count where the questions had the tag 'drop box' in the data.
