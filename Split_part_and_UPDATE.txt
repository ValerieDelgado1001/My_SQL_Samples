-- In this sample I am aggregating text values to find the most common requests using rtrim() and split_part() then updating the text in
the evanston311 dataset. The data set has 150 distinct values in category but some of them start with the text "main category-details". 
This is the distinct value we are looking for that we need to change to a new standardized value based off other contents in the text. 

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS recode;

CREATE TEMP TABLE recode AS 
 
SELECT DISTINCT category,
	rtrim(split_part(category, '-',1)) AS standardized
FROM
    evanston311;

UPDATE recode SET standardized = 'Trash Cart' WHERE LIKE 'Trash%Cart';
UPDATE recode SET standardized = 'Snow Removal' WHERE LIKE 'Snow%Removal%';
UPDATE recode SET standardized = 'UNUSED' WHERE IN ('THIS REQUEST IS INACTIVE...Trash Cart',
						'(DO NOT USE) water bill','DO NOT USE Trash',
                                                'NO LONGER IN USE');

SELECT
    standardized, COUNT(*) 
FROM 
    evanston311
LEFT JOIN recode
ON evanston.category = recode.category
GROUP BY standardized
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
