-- In the Electric grid database I use Declare to set multiple variables and a select statement that calls those variables USING SQLserver.

DECLARE @start DATE
DECLARE @stop DATE
DECLARE @affected INT

SET @start = '2014-01-24'
SET @stop = '2014-07-02'
SET @affected = 5000;

SELECT 
    description,
    nerc_region,
    demand_loss_mw,
    affected_customers
FROM
    grid
WHERE event_date BETWEEN @start AND @stop
AND affected_customers >= @affected;
