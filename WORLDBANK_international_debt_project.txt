-- In this project I examine the WORLD BANK database. The data I looked at came from the International_debt from years 1970-2015.


--I start by looking at a sample section of the dataset to get familiar with what types of data I will be analyzing.
  

SELECT * FROM international_debt LIMIT 10;


--I can see in the table that there are repeating names in the country name column. my next step is to count the unique countries in the 
table.


SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT country_name) AS total_distict_countries
FROM internationa debt;


--There are 124 total countries in this dataset. I also noticed that the column labeled indicator_code also seems to have some repeating
values. I want to know how many specific indicator_codes does each distinct country have?



SELECT DISTINCT indicator_code AS  disticnt_debt_indicators
FROM international_debt
ORDER BY distinct_debt_indicators;


--Now the data is easier to read and I can see each country and the list of distinct debt indicators for each country.
I would like to know what the total debt is for each country.


SELECT 
    ROUND(SUM(debt)/1000000,2) AS total_debt
FROM international_debt;


--The total debt column is easier to read using the ROUND function but now I am just looking for the country that has the highest amount of
debt.


SELECT 
    country_name,
    ROUND(SUM(debt)/1000000,2) AS total_debt
FROM international_debt
GROUP BY country_name
ORDER BY total_debt DESC
LIMIT 1;


-- In this Project I discovered information from the international_debt dataset and organized the unique country names and the distinct 
indicator codes. Then I forund the total debt per country and cleaned up the data to make it more readable with the ROUND function. Using 
those techniques I was able to find the country with the highest total debt.
