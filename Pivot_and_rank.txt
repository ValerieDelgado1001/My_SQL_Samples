--In this example I count the gold medals that France (FRA) and the UK (GBR), and Germany (GER) have earned per country and year using 
pivoting and ranking in the summer_medals dataset.

 
SELECT 
    country,
    year,
    COUNT(*) AS Medals
FROM summer_medals
WHERE 
    country IN ('FRA', 'GBR', 'GER')
    AND year IN (2004, 2008, 2012)
    AND medal = 'Gold'
GROUP BY country, year
ORDER BY country, year;
