-- Created a CTE containting an ordered count of values using Row_number() Window function to find the MODE() of OrderPrice.Then I Wrote
 a Query using the CTE to pick the value with the Highest row #. I added a more detailed explanation of what I did to show my thought 
process.




--First I partitoined orderprice into groups and ordered them in ascending order. Then numbered and aliased to UnitPriceFrequency and 
aliased the entire query in CTE as ModePrice.

WITH ModePrice( OrderPrice, UnitPriceFrequency)
  AS (
SELECT OrderPrice,
    ROW_NUMBER() Over(PARTITION BY orderprice ORDER BY Orderprice)
                       AS UnitPriceFrequency
FROM Orders
)


-- Then I used a select statement with a derived table to find the highest numbered UnitPriceFrequency and return the OrderPrice that 
was associated with that observation.


SELECT OrderPrice AS ModeOrderPrice 
FROM ModePrice
WHERE UnitPriceFrequency IN (
    SELECT MAX(UnitPriceFrequency) 
    FROM ModePrice)
