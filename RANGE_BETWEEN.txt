--Here I am returning the year and the city (using the RANGE BETWEEN()window function)in which each olympic games were held. 
I fetch the last city in which the olympic games were held.

WITH Hosts AS (
	SELECT DISTINCT year, city
	FROM summer_medals)

SELECT 
    year,
    city,
    LAST_VALUE(city) OVER(
		ORDER BY year
		RANGE BETWEEN
		UNBOUND PRECEDING AND 
		UNBOUND FOLLOWING
	    ) AS Last_city
FROM Hosts
ORDER BY year;
