--In this sample I show how I achive returning a running total (using aggregation with a window function) of medals per athlete. I am 
returning the athletes, the number of medals they earned, and the medals running total, ordered by the athletes' names in alphabetical 
order.


WITH Athlete_Medals AS (
	SELECT 
	athlete, COUNT(*) AS Medals
	FROM summer_medals
	WHERE
	    country = 'USA' AND medals = 'Gold'
	    AND year >= 2000
	GROUP BY athlete)
SELECT 
    athlete,
    Medals,
    SUM(Medals) OVER(ORDER BY athlete) AS Max_Medals

FROM Athlete_Medals
ORDER BY athlete;
