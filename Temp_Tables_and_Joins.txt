--Using a temp table(SELECT INTO) and joins, I select the longest tracks from every album and collect them in a new table called #maxtracks.
then I order the list from greatest to least and alphabeticaly by artist.

SELECT album.title AS album_title,
    aritst.name AS artist,
    MAX(track.milliseconds/(1000*60)% 60) AS Max_track_length_mins

INTO #maxtracks
FROM album
INNER JOIN artist
ON album.artist_id = artist.artist_id
INNER JOIN track 
ON track.album_id = album.album_id
GROUP BY artist_id,
    album.title,
    artist.name,
    album.album_id

SELECT
    album_title,
    artist,
    max_track_length_mins
FROM #maxtracks
ORDER BY max_track_lenght_mins DESC,
    artist;
