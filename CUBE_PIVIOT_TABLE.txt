--In this sample I am prepairing a report about national preferences of the customers from MoviesNow compairing the average rating of movies
across countries and genres. This requires me to use the CUBE() function to collect all possible combinations of country and genre ratings 
of movies in a pivot table. 

SELECT 
    c.country
    m.genre
    AVG(r.rating) AS avg_rating
FROM renting AS r
LEFT JOIN movies AS m
ON m.movie_id = r.movie_id
LEFT JOIN customers AS c
ON r.customers_id = c.customers_id
GROUP BY CUBE(c.country, m.genre);
