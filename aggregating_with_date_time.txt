-- In this example I am subtracting date and time values along with the title and the recorded rental duration that are located in three 
tables(film, inventory, rental).

SELECT f.title, f.rental_duration,
    r.return_date - r.rental_date AS days_rented
FROM film AS f
	INNER JOIN inventory AS i ON f.film_id = i.film_id
	INNER JOIN rental AS r ON i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id
ORDER BY f.title;
