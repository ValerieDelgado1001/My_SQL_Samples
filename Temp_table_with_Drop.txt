-- In this example I Find the fortune500 companies that have profits in the top 20% for their sector. I use a temporary Table and the
percentile_disc() function to find the 80th percentile of the profit of each sector.


DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Profit80;

CREATE TEMP TABLE Profit80 AS 
	SELECT sector, percentile_disc(0.8) WITHIN GROUP(ORDER BY Profits) AS pct80
	FROM fortune500
	GROUP BY sector;
SELECT title, fortune500.sector, profits, profits/pct80 AS ratio
FROM frotune500
    LEFTJOIN profit80
    ON fortune500.sector = profits80.sector
WHERE profits > pct80;
