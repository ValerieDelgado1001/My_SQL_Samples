-- Using a table called company I Joined the table to itself to add information about a companys parent to the original company info.
Then I used the COALESCE() function to get the parent company ticker(when avalible) and the Original company ticker When parent company 
ticker was not avalible. Then using a second table called fortune500 I used an INNER JOIN to bring the ticker column to the company table.


SELECT 
    company_original.name, title, rank
FROM company AS company_original
    LEFT JOIN company AS company_parent
    ON company_original.parent_id = company_parent.parent_id
    INNER JOIN fortune500
    ON COALESCE (Company_original.ticker, company_parent.ticker) = fortune500.ticker
ORDER BY rank;
