--This is a project that I worked on using NYC public school Test results scores. 

-- Started by familiarizing myself with the dataset.


SELECT * FROM schools LIMIT 10;


--I noticed that some data was missing in the percent_tested column and I wanted to know how many schools had missing data in that column.
I needed to know this to see if it was a wide spread problem with this dataset. 


SELECT COUNT(*) - COUNT(precent_tested) AS num_tested_missing,
    COUNT(*) AS num_schools
FROM schools;


--20 schools were missing data for the percent_tested column. I noticed in the data that some of the schools had the same building code
so the num_schools in the last query may not represent the total number of unique schools in the dataset. 


SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT building_code) AS num_school_buildings
FROM schools;



--There are 233 unique school building_codes. Now we know that the 20 schools with missing data may not be that wide spread of an issue.
now we move on to analyzing the school preformance. Each school reports individually and not by building code so I will use the individual
data to get the average math score of each school that reaches atleast 80%. The score is out of 800 so 80% would be 640.


SELECT school_name,
    average_math
FROM schools
WHERE average_math >= 640
ORDER BY average_math DESC;


--Only 10 public schools in NYC with an average math score of atleast 640. Now I am getting curious and I would like to Know what the lowest
reading score is from all the schools.


SELECT MIN(average_reading) AS lowest_reading
FROM schools;


--That was interesting but not note worthy so I move on. Now I am looking for the school with the highest average writing score.

SELECT school_name, 
     MAX(average_writing) AS max_writing
FROM schools
GROUP BY school_name
ORDER BY max_writing DESC
LIMIT 1;


--Now we have found something interesting! The top writing school was the same school that got the top math score. I wonder what other 
schools are showing excellent scores across the board?


SELECT school_name, SUM(average_math + average_reading + average_writing) AS average_sat
FROM schools
GROUP BY school_name
ORDER BY average_sat DESC
LIMIT 10;


--Out of the top ten I noticed that the top 4 schools all had scores above 2000. I noticed at the beginning that the schools could also 
be grouped by borough. I wonder how these top scoring schoools effect the score of school performance by borough.


SELECT borough, COUNT(*) AS num_schools, 
    SUM(average_reading + average_writitng + average_math)/ COUNT(*) AS average_borough_sat
FROM schools
GROUP BY borough
ORDER BY average_borough_sat DESC;



--From these queries I analyzed The top preforming schools from NYC by prefomance scores and saw how those scores effected the groups of 
schools in each borough.
